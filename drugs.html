    <h2>The Drug life.</h2>
<body>
   Ok now onto my teen years. This is where my life got really rough so buckle up because you are in for a ride. My class A 
   addiction started by me being tricked in a way. I know you probably won't believe this but its the truth. I was drinking one night
   at a house party in the house we always went to and I drank way too much and ended up throwing up and getting put in bed. At about 4am
   the 'Alpha' of the group came up and gave me a pill and told it me was paracetamol to stop me feeling rough when I wake up, I was 13 and 
   dumb so I took him for his word. This is where my drug addiction started, for the next 3 years I done things
   I regret to keep the drug dealers who we were dealing for happy. This lead to me being stabbed twice by the time
   I was 16 for the main reason of dealing in certain areas to make sure we had our money to pay our drug dealers
   so nothing would happen to our families or us. My life at this point revolved around where was my next line of cocaine coming from.
   I didn't care about anything but the drug, I was stealing from family and random people in the street and living a life that still gets to me now.
   I have done stuff in the past that adds to my depression now that I will not go into on this blog but it is enough to increase the severity of my
   depression due to the guilt it makes me feel. When I was 15 drugs lead me to a house party, during this party my drink was spiked and I was sexually assaulted
   by a 37 year old married man and this is when my life started going down hill real quick and took 13 years to start to recover.
   This is what lead to when I was 16. I was at a house party I took ecstacy and drank a lot of vodka straight from the bottle and the last thing I remember
   is falling through the front door of the house and then I woke up in hospital which caused me to get clean and go sober from drugs. This is when the depression started
   to take hold of me.
