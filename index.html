    Where to start? This is a blog based on the struggles I deal with each day with depression but 
    before then I should introduce you to me and my past for you to understand why I struggle.

<h3>The Start of my life</h3>
<body>
    My name is Luke and I am a 30 year old from Liverpool, England. I was born in 1990 and was raised in Anfield, Liverpool.
    I had an easy life for the first 9 - 10 years, other than the usual family stuff people deal with. This is when
    my life took a slow turn for the worse. My parents divorced and from what I recall it wasn't an amicable split, the first memory
    I have of the split is being told that my parents were splitting up, being told this broke me inside. My whole life was based on my
    family being together and now everything I knew was gone. That day I was picked up by my dad from school and all I remember is holding on
    to my dad crying my eyes out the whole walk home. This leads onto after the break up, my dad was the usual drunk. By usual drunk I mean he was 
    barely ever keeping up to his promises and causing my mum to have to deal with 4 sons being let down by the person they wanted to see the most.
    This is where my stepdad comes in, Peter the person I felt cared more about us than our own dad did but I was wrong. My dad was an alcoholic and 
    it turns out my step dad had substance abuse issues(my mums choice in men clearly sucks). Now we fast forward abit since this is based on things I
    can remember and this is my next memory. I hit 12 and get stop wanting to see my dad because things seem weird there. After I make this decision to
    stop going around to my dads he rings me. This is when I find out my dad is gay which hit me a LOT harder back then compared to what it would if I found
    out on this day. It felt like my dad wasn't my dad anymore and that I had been lied to for so long by someone I was supposed to be able to trust.
    I would say this is the start of my depression starting to kick in, it felt like the mask had been ripped off and now I was seeing the real world.
    Now we fast forward again to when I turned 13. I started hanging around with a group of lads every weekend and you can probably guess where this is going to lead.
    I was 13 when I first started smoking weed and trust me when they say it is a gateway to other drugs, this is only true when you have a certain group
    of people around you.
